Given a projective representation of a group, how to deduce the corresponding element of the group cohomology?

Does the situation change for finite/continous groups?

# Gauge invariant terms
One can construct "gauge invariant" phases that do this automatically. For Z2 x Z2, can use $U(a)U(b)U^{-1}(a)U^{-1}(b)$. Straightforward to generalise for an arbitrary group? Maybe just consider all possible combinations.
* Need to show that it is well defined and represents all possible classes.
* For continuous groups, could use infinitesimal generators?
* Software to automatically deduce cohomology group?
