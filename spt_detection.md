# 1D

Looking for cohomology class of $H_{2}(G, U(1))$.

## Action on the boundary
Ground state is degenerate, symmetry action transforms as a projective representation on the edge.

## Action on the MPS
For a translationally invariant MPS, the on site symmetries applied to the physical bonds can be transferred to actiing on the virtual bonds. In this way the symmetry can be seen to act on the basis of Schmidt states of the decomposition.
* But what about non-onsite symmetries, like the cluster state? Could use a unit cell of 2 sites and combine...
* Formula in F. Pollman's paper, compute an eigenvector from the mixed transfer matrix.

## RG fixed  point
Can apply a RG transformation repeatedly to simplify the state, then deduce.
* Could one apply this as a pre-processing step for simplification...?

## Degeneraices in the entanglement spectrum
* Arises from the fact that non-trivial irreducible representations of the symmetry must have dimensions greater than one, and also act on the reduced density matrices.
    * But what is the entanglement spectrum...?

## String order parameter
See F. Pollman paper

## Entanglement entropy
See QI meets QM paper.
